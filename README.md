# Co-ordinate-geometry-Class
import this class and get access to co-ordinate geometry functions.
The CoordinateGeometry class provides various formulas related to coordinate geometry.
It contains methods for calculating the distance between two points, the midpoint of a line segment, the slope of a line passing through two points, the y-intercept of a line passing through two points, the x-intercept of a line passing through two points, the slope and y-intercept of a line passing through two points, the equation of a line passing through a point with a given slope, the distance between a point and a line with a given equation, and the equation of the perpendicular bisector of a line segment.
All of the methods take in the necessary inputs as arguments and return the result of the calculation.
The class is designed to be flexible and allow for a variety of different inputs and output types, including tuples for representing points and both floats and None for intercepts when appropriate.
This class can be useful for anyone who needs to perform calculations related to coordinate geometry, such as students or professionals in fields such as mathematics, engineering, physics, or computer science.
By encapsulating all of these formulas in a single class, it can help simplify code and make it easier to maintain and update.
